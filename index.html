 <h4>Professional Information </h4>
<p>I come from the other side of the earth where the cities looks pretty much the same bacause of industrial development and globalization.
   I enjoy the convenience that modern technology bring us but hate it when people grow attachment on those motionless devices and ignore the most valuable face-to-face communication.
   I'm turning 22 two months later and hopefully I can figure out what I really want for my life in the rest days of my college life.
 </p>            
                         
<h4> Career Objective </h4>

<p>
  I want to obtain a position in a transnational company utilizing my writing, computer and communication skills based on my education background. 
  In fact, what I really want to do every day from the bottom of my heart is to read, write, walk and feel the world. That's sentimental! But I will, fight for it even though I have to do something I'm not really fond of to be closer to the dream.
</p>
                          
                          
<h4> Work Experience </h4>

<ul>
<li>Student assistant in Office of Graduate Admissions (Chicago, IL) 2013-present </li>
</ul>


<p>
  Fun experience!　It's the first job I got in Chicago and the first time for me to work with foreigh coworkers.
  Working as a student assistant at the Office of Graduate Admission, I open mails, respond emails, review application materials for graduate applicants.
  One thing I like about this job is that I'm helping people and making money at the same time, that's exactly what I like to do.
  One thing I hate about it is that when I find people are lazy, including me. Sometimes people are not really focus on their work and this can easily influence other person's life (application-wise).
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Assistant in a DELL retailer store (Nanjing, China)  2011
</li>
</ul>


<p>
  First time as a saleswoman and I'm clearly not doing a wonderful job, lol! I only sold one computer and the buyer is my friend.
  However, it's surprising to me that how low the profit is in computer industry. Things start to lose value when there are too many of them in the market. 
  That's why people don't want to be normal and that's sad because most of them unavoidably end up being normal.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Summer Intern, Assistant in the Zhujiang Road Technical Management Office (Nanjing, China) 2010 
</li>
</ul>


<p>
   Office is dull!　I collected and analyzed data for the office of Zhujiang Road Technical Management. 
   Also, the annual computer festival is held in summer and the office is the organizer. I helped them prepare for all the settings and took photos.
   This was actually interesting and it was so amazing to see so many new technology display in front of my eyes. 
</p>


<h4> Education</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Illinois Institute of Technology(IIT)
2013-present
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I transferred to IIT as a Communication major in 2013 fall and is continuing to explore my life in here. For me, IIT is the best school.
Although there are so many elite schools out there and some of my Chinese friends here are all thinking about transfering to a better school for a better certificate.
I personally don't feel this way. My coming to IIT is somehow very coincidental and I always believe that every step I take, as long as it's not fataly wrong, is for a reason.
So far, I appreciate everything that IIT has offered me, good or bad. They are all becoming a part of my life.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Jiangsu University
2011-2013
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I majored in English and studied two years in Jiangsu University with an average GPA of 3.7. During this time, I was the head of our school's foreign affair department. I also won the second-level scholarship two years in a row. 
But I'm not really enjoying the life there. I felt like I'm not moving forward. I need a change. That's the reason why I decide to study in America, a place that lures me with it's culture and spirit.
