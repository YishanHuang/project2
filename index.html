 <h1>Yishan Huang: Background and ambitions</h1>
 
 <p>
My name is Yishan Huang and I'm a 3rd-year international student from China.I love reading and 
doing sports. So basically, I can adapt to a new environment very quick.
</p>
<p>
Before transferred to IIT, I was studying English in a Chinese university where I grew the 
interest of learning new stuff of the Internet. I believe that the Internet is such a great 
invention that it has changed almost everything of the modern world.So, keeping myself updated is a habit of mine. 
</p>
<p>
However, without professional training and lack of patience, this habit of mine has not carried 
on. That's why I choose this class, not only because it is an requirement, also continues my dream.
</p>
<p>
After the first several classes, I think that this course is worth taking but demand highly from students. I'm still confused about using some of the stuff and sometimes get lost in class.
This fall semester will be busy for me because I'm taking six classes and working 20 hours a week. But I'll try my best to balance this two and make the most of class time. Hopefully I'll be able to comprehend and master this course and use it in my future career. I also remind myself that excellence comes from practice.
